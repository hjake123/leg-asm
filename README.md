Assembler for my LEG architecture computer in the game Turing Complete.

Note that this assembler is tailored to the architectural choices I made when playing the game, so it will be useless for any other project.

Now featuring new simulator! With this, the assembly language can be run without needing to even open the game!

The binary for the rust version of the simulator can be built using `cargo build` in the rust-legsim directory. Remember, rust-legsim is just a simulator, not an assembler! You still need to use legasm.py to get the "assembled" file.
